# ICP-EVM Integration Starter Template

This template provides a seamless integration between Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canisters and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based smart contracts. It uses Rust for the backend canister and includes a simple Solidity smart contract for demonstration.

It has been built on top of the [evm rpc rust](https://github.com/fxgst/evm-rpc-rust/tree/main) template by [Elias Datler](https://github.com/fxgst).

Link to canister URLs: 
1. [Frontend](https://inuxd-qiaaa-aaaal-qjigq-cai.icp0.io/)
2. [Backend](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=gr5at-6yaaa-aaaal-qjfiq-cai)

## Quick Start

To get started with this template, run the following command:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephen-Kimoi/icp-evm-rust-bridge/main/install_and_deploy.sh)" -- project-name
```

This script will:
1. Create a new project
2. Clone this template into the new project
3. Install dependencies
4. Start a local replica
5. Deploy the canister

After running the script, your project will be set up and ready to use!

Once the canister is deployed, this is what you'll see:

## Backend (Rust Canister)

### eth_call.rs

This file contains the core functionality for interacting with EVM-based smart contracts.

Key components:
- `call_smart_contract`: Handles both read and write operations to the smart contract. It encodes the function call, sends it to the Ethereum network, and decodes the result.
- `sign_transaction`: Signs transactions for write operations using ECDSA.
- `pubkey_and_signature`: Retrieves the ECDSA public key and generates a signature for a given transaction hash.
- `get_ecdsa_public_key`: Fetches the ECDSA public key associated with the canister.
- `next_id`: Retrieves the next transaction nonce for the canister's Ethereum address.
- Helper functions for data conversion and transaction signing.

### lib.rs

This is the main entry point for the canister, containing the public functions that can be called.

Key functions:
- `get_latest_ethereum_block`: Retrieves the latest block from the Ethereum network.
- `get_canister_eth_address`: Derives the Ethereum address for the canister.
- `call_increase_count`: Increases the counter in the smart contract.
- `get_count`: Retrieves the current count from the smart contract.
- `call_decrease_count`: Decreases the counter in the smart contract.

## Smart Contract (Solidity)

### Counter.sol

A simple smart contract that implements a counter with functions to increase, decrease, and get the current count. You can edit and add your smart contract code over here. 

## Usage

### Read Functionalities
Clicking on the `Get Canister ETH Address` button will generate the Ethereum address of the canister.

Clicking on `Get Count` will return the count value.

### Write Functionalities
The buttons `Increase Count` and `Decrease Count` perform write operations to the smart contract deployed on Sepolia.

#### Note: Write functions require the canister to have ETH for gas fees. For local deployments, you may need to send test ETH to the canister's address, which changes regularly.

### Editing Your Code
To get started with editing your code, ensure you've changed the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `ABI_JSON` in the `lib.rs` file inside the `backend/src` directory.

```rust
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS: &str = "0xAed5d7b083ad30ad6B50f698427aD4907845AAc3";

const ABI_JSON: &str = r#"
   [
        {
            "inputs": [],
            "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
            "type": "constructor"
        },
        {
            "inputs": [],
            "name": "decreaseCount",
            "outputs": [],
            "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
            "type": "function"
        },
        {
            "inputs": [],
            "name": "getCount",
            "outputs": [
                {
                "internalType": "uint256",
                "name": "",
                "type": "uint256"
                }
            ],
            "stateMutability": "view",
            "type": "function"
        },
        {
            "inputs": [],
            "name": "increaseCount",
            "outputs": [],
            "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
            "type": "function"
        }
    ]
"#;
```

### Creating Read Functionalities

To create a read functionality, you can use the following example as a template:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::update]
async fn get_count() -> Result<u64, String> {
    let abi = get_abi();
    
    let result = call_smart_contract(
        CONTRACT_ADDRESS.to_string(), 
        &abi, 
        "getCount", 
        &[], 
        false, // This is a read operation
        None // Chain ID
    ).await?;

    let count_value = result
        .get(0)
        .ok_or("Expected a single value in the return value")?
        .clone()
        .into_uint()
        .ok_or("Expected a uint256 value")?;

    Ok(count_value.low_u64())
}
```

### Creating Write Functionalities

For write operations, you can use the following example:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::update]
async fn call_increase_count() -> Result<String, String> {
    let abi = get_abi();

    let result = call_smart_contract(
        CONTRACT_ADDRESS.to_string(),
        &abi,
        "increaseCount",
        &[],
        true, // This is a write operation
        Some(U256::from(11155111)), // Sepolia chain ID
    )
    .await;

    match result {
        Ok(tx_hash) => Ok(format!("Increased count. Transaction hash: {:?}", tx_hash)),
        Err(e) => Err(format!("Failed to send transaction: {:?}", e))
    }
}
```

### Important Notes

- Ensure you've updated the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `ABI_JSON` in the `lib.rs` file to match your deployed smart contract.
- Write operations require the canister to have ETH for gas fees. For local deployments, you may need to send test ETH to the canister's address.
- The canister's Ethereum address may change in local deployments, so be aware of this when testing write functionalities.

## Upcoming Features

We are continuously working to improve this template and add new features. Some of the features that are currently in development and will be implemented soon include:

1. Enhanced error handling and logging for better debugging.
2. Support for more complex smart contract interactions, including handling of structs and arrays.
3. Integration with multiple EVM-compatible networks.
4. Improved gas estimation for more efficient transactions.
5. A user-friendly interface for deploying and managing smart contracts directly from the canister.
6. Support for event listening and webhook notifications for smart contract events.
7. Integration with popular Ethereum development tools like Hardhat and Truffle.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates that will make your ICP-EVM integration even more powerful and flexible!
